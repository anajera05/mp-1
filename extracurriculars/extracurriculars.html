                <p class ="description">
                    We are dedicated to creating a supportive community for young computer scientists of all genders and
                    deepening awareness and interest in the many areas of CS. We feature speakers on a variety of CS topics,
                    host career-related events, and bring together and collaborate with individuals passionate about computer
                    science, math, engineering, business, and related fields. Computer science touches so many facets of our
                    lives - from the virtual assistants on our smartphones to the algorithms running our medical equipment
                    to the software that sends rockets into the stars - that it's impossible to not be "into computers."
                    We hope that we can help all students, regardless of gender, to see that computer science can be for
                    everyone - dreamers, tinkerers, coders, and thinkers - and to discover all that CS has to offer.
